## Overview

This plugin allows you to expose all critical models and operations as graphql queries and mutations<br />
It uses api-platform with xml mappings for models
It also handles JWT communication

To check automatically generated API Doc for graphql in Your project - visit one of following endpoints.

```
  api_graphql_entrypoint              /api/v2/graphql                                                                   
  api_graphql_graphiql                /api/v2/graphql/graphiql                                                          
  api_graphql_graphql_playground      /api/v2/graphql/graphql_playground
